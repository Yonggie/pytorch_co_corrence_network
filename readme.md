inspired by:https://github.com/IvanFei/Co-Occurrence-Layer.pytorch/blob/32acd7602fece221b8e0ee71a9c2ddbfe4b11204/src/co_layer.py#L14

author official:https://github.com/Shevlev/Co-occurrence-Neural-Network

## tested enviroment
pytorch=1.9.0

python=3.8

I think most of torch of any version are applicable.
